 abstract = {We investigate the modulation performance of a metamaterial/graphene optoelectronic device in the THz range. Operating characteristics such as amplitude, phase and polarization modulations of broadband THz radiation are reported. The accomplishments of modulation depth include $>$75% in spectral amplitude, \textsuperscript\ circ\$ in spectral phase, \$\ gt 0.2\$ active modulation of ellipticity ratio, and active rotational angle changes of 20°. These achievements are the key elements towards efficient manipulations of THz radiation for applications such as next-generation wireless communications, spectroscopy, and imaging.},
