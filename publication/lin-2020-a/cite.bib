 abstract = {We demonstrate how terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) operating in reflection geometry can be used for quantitative conductivity mapping of large area chemical vapor deposited graphene films through silicon support. We validate the technique against measurements performed using the established transmission based THz-TDS. Our through-substrate approach allows unhindered access to the graphene top surface and thus, as we discuss, opens up pathways to perform in situ and in-operando THz-TDS using environmental cells.},
