 abstract = {Remote epitaxy is an emerging materials synthesis technique which employs a 2D interface layer, often graphene, to enable the epitaxial deposition of low defect single crystal films while restricting bonding between the growth layer and the underlying substrate. This allows for the subsequent release of the epitaxial film for integration with other systems and reuse of growth substrates. This approach is applicable to material systems with an ionic component to their bonding, making it notably appealing for III– V alloys, which are a technologically important family of materials. Chemical vapour deposition growth of graphene and wet transfer to a III– V substrate with a polymer handle is a potentially scalable and low cost approach to producing the required growth surface for remote epitaxy of these materials, however, the presence of water promotes the formation of a III– V oxide layer, which degrades the quality of subsequently grown epitaxial films. This work demonstrates the use of an argon ion beam for the controlled introduction of defects in a monolayer graphene interface layer to enable the growth of a single crystal GaAs film by molecular beam epitaxy, despite the presence of a native oxide at the substrate/graphene interface. A hybrid mechanism of defect seeded lateral overgrowth with remote epitaxy contributing the coalescence of the film is indicated. The exfoliation of the GaAs films reveals the presence of defect seeded nucleation sites, highlighting the need to balance the benefits of defect seeding on crystal quality against the requirement for subsequent exfoliation of the film, for future large area development of this approach.},
