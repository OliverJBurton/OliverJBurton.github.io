Following a decade of advancement, Cu2O photocathodes are capable of delivering a performance comparable to that of photoelectrodes with established photovoltaic materials3--5. However, considerable bulk charge carrier recombination that is poorly understood still limits further advances in performance6. Here we demonstrate performance of Cu2O photocathodes beyond the state-of-the-art by exploiting a new conceptual understanding of carrier recombination and transport in single-crystal Cu2O thin films. Using ambient liquid-phase epitaxy, we present a new method to grow single-crystal Cu2O samples with three crystal orientations. Broadband femtosecond transient reflection spectroscopy measurements were used to quantify anisotropic optoelectronic properties, through which the carrier mobility along the [111] direction was found to be an order of magnitude higher than those along other orientations. Driven by these findings, we developed a polycrystalline Cu2O photocathode with an extraordinarily pure (111) orientation and (111) terminating facets using a simple and low-cost method, which delivers 7,mA,cm-2 current density (more than 70% improvement compared to that of state-of-the-art electrodeposited devices) at 0.5,V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode under air mass 1.5,G illumination, and stable operation over at least 120,h.","tags":["Devices for energy harvesting","Solar fuels"],"title":"High Carrier Mobility along the [111] Orientation in Cu2O Photoelectrodes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Teja Potočnik","Oliver Burton","Marcel Reutzel","David Schmitt","Jan Philipp Bange","Stefan Mathias","Fabian R.

Here we introduce spectroscopic ellipsometric contrast microscopy (SECM) as a tool for mapping twist angle disorder in optically resonant twisted bilayer graphene. We optimize the ellipsometric angles to enhance the image contrast based on measured and calculated reflection coefficients of incident light. The optical resonances associated with van Hove singularities correlate well to Raman and angle-resolved photoelectron emission spectroscopy, confirming the accuracy of SECM. The results highlight the advantages of SECM, which proves to be a fast, nondestructive method for characterization of twisted bilayer graphene over large areas, unlocking process, material, and device screening and cross-correlative measurement potential for bilayer and multilayer materials.","tags":[],"title":"Fast Twist Angle Mapping of Bilayer Graphene Using Spectroscopic Ellipsometric Contrast Microscopy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Oliver J.

Bringing both together remains a challenge due to the vast, interconnected parameter space. We introduce a fast-screening descriptor approach to demonstrate holistic data-driven optimization across the entirety of process steps for the graphene– Cu model system. We map the crystallographic dependences of graphene chemical vapor deposition, interfacial Cu oxidation to decouple graphene, and its dry delamination across inverse pole figures. Their overlay enables us to identify hitherto unexplored (168) higher index Cu orientations as overall optimal orientations. We show the effective preparation of such Cu orientations via epitaxial close-space sublimation and achieve mechanical transfer with a very high yield ($\u003e$95%) and quality of graphene domains, with room-temperature electron mobilities in the range of 40000 cm2/(V s). Our approach is readily adaptable to other descriptors and 2D material systems, and we discuss the opportunities of such a holistic optimization.","tags":[],"title":"Putting High-Index Cu on the Map for High-Yield, Dry-Transferred CVD Graphene","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abdullah M.

The polarization modulation performance of an integrated metamaterial/graphene device is investigated via a modified THz time domain spectroscopic system. Graphene's Fermi level is modified through electrostatic gating, thus modifying the device's overall optical response. Active tuning of ellipticity by $\u003e$0.3 is reported at the resonant frequency of 0.80~THz. The optical activity of transmitted THz radiations is continuously modified by $\u003e$21.5o at 0.71~THz. By carefully selecting the transmitted frequency with the relative angle between the incoming linear polarization and the device's symmetry axis, active circular dichroism and optical activity are almost independently exploited. Finally, this all-electronically tuneable versatile polarization device can be used in all applications requiring an ultrafast modulation such as polarization spectroscopy, imaging, and THz wireless generation.","tags":[],"title":"Versatile and Active THz Wave Polarization Modulators Using Metamaterial/Graphene Resonators","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Oliver J Burton","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

This unique disability affects an estimated 394,000 people in the UK only with different degrees of severity [2]. Either or both of the disabilities that form deafblindness can be congenital or acquired in later life for example due to ageing. The combined hearing and vision loss affects significantly the life of an individual even if, when taken separately, each single sensory impairment can be relatively mild. Due to an increasing ageing population, this combined sensory disability is predicted to affect half a million of the UK population by 2030 [3]. Living with deafblindness is very challenging, both for the individual and for the family members as the combination of the two impairments creates a unique and severe disability which impacts heavily on how an individual knows and interacts with the external world. In deafblindess, not only communication is impaired but access and retrieval of information and mobility are significantly affected too. Technology for either blind or deaf people has improved significantly over the past decades. A plethora of applications and software is available to read both digital and physical documents aloud or send it to a braille keyboard. Deaf people now have the ability to speak using advanced synthesised voices, allowing for natural communication over the telephone. Unfortunately, braille keyboards can be anywhere from £1500 to £10000 [4] and if a person suffers from deafblindness most of the existing technology for either disability is no longer an option. Commercial offerings of braille displays and speech recognition software operate under closed systems, whereby devices and software obtained from one manufacturer cannot be used with those from another. It is therefore extremely difficult and expensive for a potential developer to integrate existing commercial technology for the deaf and blind, raising the barrier for the advancement and uptake of technologies to assist people affected by a combined sight and hearing loss.\nProject overview This project sets out to develop a means whereby deafblind people can communicate with the external world. In this work, we combine open source speech-recognition technologies with a haptic interface to develop a new assistive technology device which gives braille-literate deafblind people the ability to understand spoken words. Recently, it has become cost-effective and easy to interface software with custom-purpose hardware, such as in the open-source Arduino and Raspberry Pi projects. We decided to leverage this and focus on the novel aspects of our technology rather than spending development time on low-level hardware control, or on advanced machine learning algorithms underpinning a speech-recognition software. A simplified block diagram of the system developed is displayed below. Software able to convert speech directly into braille has been created using already available speech-to-text interpreters such as Sphynx and Google’s speech API [7]. Spoken words, captured by means of microphone are firstly translated to text by the speech-recognition software on a Raspberry Pi. The text is then sent serially to an Arduino which processes it into a form that can be taken by our novel haptic interface, based on miniaturized linear actuators, and finally displayed into braille.\nFigure 1 Simplified block diagram of the system developed.\nDue to the constraints of the braille letter size, a very small motor was needed to drive the mechanism. We chose a cheaply and readily available 4-wire-2-phase stepper motor (shown in figure 2) to drive the mechanism. At under 3.5mm in diameter, these stepper motors rotated in 1/8th turns at a minimum of 5ms per step (up to 25 rotations per second) allowing for ample speed and control in a very compact space. As can be seen in figure 2, the motors are extremely small with the shaft having helical grooves that were found to match up to a M1 nut. A small metal rod was soldered onto the nut to act as the pin, and another piece of metal was shaped to confine the movement of the pin along the axis of the shaft. Each of the motor’s coils were 23 ohms and required a current of approximately 50mA to provide unobstructed rotation of the shaft. In this project we used the Arduino as the microcontroller to turn the text from a computer into the actuation of pins to form the braille characters. A Raspberry Pi was used as a desktop, though the basic software will work with any computer capable of running python 3.0+. The Arduino was connected to the shift register through three pins, and code written to allow the translation of text into a number of braille characters – the system is set up so that the shift registers which control each character can …","date":1456790400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1456790400,"objectID":"b5c2d6d6002991c5da650febb1a15805","permalink":"https://example.com/project/acorn/","publishdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/acorn/","section":"project","summary":"A cheap alternative to piezoelectric Braille keyboards and speech recognition implementation for deaf-blind people.","tags":["Deaf-blind","Speech recognition","Actuator","Braille","Keyboard","Engineering"],"title":"CAPE Acorn Award - speech to braille","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"google-site-verification: google7593e86a1c23b6c9.html","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"a535aada5b39d31f1593f38b2f342771","permalink":"https://example.com/google7593e86a1c23b6c9/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/google7593e86a1c23b6c9/","section":"","summary":"google-site-verification: google7593e86a1c23b6c9.","tags":null,"title":"","type":"page"}]
