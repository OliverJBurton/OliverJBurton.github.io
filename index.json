Central to our method is an optimized machine-readable, lithographically processable, and multi-scale fiducial marker system-dubbed LithoTag-which provides nanostructure position determination at the nanometer scale. A grid of uniquely defined LithoTag markers patterned across a substrate enables image alignment and mapping in 100% of a set of $\u003e$9000 scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images ($\u003e$7 gigapixels). Combining this automated SEM imaging with a computer vision algorithm yields location and property data for individual nanowires. Starting with a random arrangement of individual InAs nanowires with diameters of 30 $±$ 5 nm on a single chip, we automatically design and fabricate $\u003e$200 single-nanowire devices. For $\u003e$75% of devices, the positioning accuracy of the fabricated electrodes is within 2 pixels of the original microscopy image resolution. The presented LithoTag method enables automation of nanodevice processing and is agnostic to microscopy modality and nanostructure type. Such high-throughput experimental methodology coupled with data-extensive science can help overcome the characterization bottleneck and improve the yield of nanodevice fabrication, driving the development and applications of nanostructured materials.","tags":[],"title":"Automated Computer Vision-Enabled Manufacturing of Nanowire Devices","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Muhammad Zulqurnain","Oliver J.

This allows for the subsequent release of the epitaxial film for integration with other systems and reuse of growth substrates. This approach is applicable to material systems with an ionic component to their bonding, making it notably appealing for III– V alloys, which are a technologically important family of materials. Chemical vapour deposition growth of graphene and wet transfer to a III– V substrate with a polymer handle is a potentially scalable and low cost approach to producing the required growth surface for remote epitaxy of these materials, however, the presence of water promotes the formation of a III– V oxide layer, which degrades the quality of subsequently grown epitaxial films. This work demonstrates the use of an argon ion beam for the controlled introduction of defects in a monolayer graphene interface layer to enable the growth of a single crystal GaAs film by molecular beam epitaxy, despite the presence of a native oxide at the substrate/graphene interface. A hybrid mechanism of defect seeded lateral overgrowth with remote epitaxy contributing the coalescence of the film is indicated. The exfoliation of the GaAs films reveals the presence of defect seeded nucleation sites, highlighting the need to balance the benefits of defect seeding on crystal quality against the requirement for subsequent exfoliation of the film, for future large area development of this approach.","tags":[],"title":"Defect Seeded Remote Epitaxy of GaAs Films on Graphene","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abdullah M.

The sub-ps conductivity rising time was attributed to the combined effect of the ultrafast generation of hot carriers in graphene and electron– hole generation in silicon. In correspondence of the resonance, it was possible to clearly distinguish a partial recovery time of $∼$2 ps mainly due to carrier-phonon relaxation in graphene, superimposed to the,$\u003e$,1,ns recovery time of silicon. The resonant metasurface yielded $∼$6,dB modulation depth in E-field amplitude at 0.8,THz for the range of fluences considered.

The possibility of further controlling the graphene conductivity via an electrolytic gate enables a new, multi-dimensional approach merging chemical field-effect sensing and microwave measurement methods.

The electronic structure and the chemical bonding states of the Co-NPs and the graphene materials were examined by using the high spatial resolution and element-specific properties of scanning transmission X-ray microscopy. X-ray absorption spectra of C, O, and Co revealed that the Co-NP size increased in accordance with the oxidation state (Co0/2+/3+), depending on the configuration of carbon bonding (C– C/C– OH/HO– C=O/O– C(O)– O/C=O– like state). We conducted a spectral comparison of the dipped graphene and the electrodeposited Co– graphene sample, which revealed an increase in C– OH formation before Co-NPs growth. In addition to electron transfer and electrochemical reduction, the oxidation evolution from C– OH to HO– C=O (or a defect) and the O– C(O)– O (or C=O) state paralleled the increase in Co-NPs size. We curve-fitted the results to demonstrate the reduction in chemical structure from mixing Co2+/3+ to Co3+/2+/0, and to explain the interfacial modulation and the unique metal Co0 layer on the surface of the Co-NPs.

Here, this state is shown to exist in monolayer graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and wet transferred on Al2O3 without encapsulation with hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) or other specialized fabrication techniques associated with superior devices. Two-terminal measurements are performed at low temperature using a GaAs-based multiplexer. During high-throughput testing, insulating properties are found in a 10 $μ$m long graphene device which is 10 $μ$m wide at one contact with an $≈$440 nm wide constriction at the other. The low magnetic field mobility is $≈$6000 cm2 V– 1 s– 1. An energy gap induced by the magnetic field opens at charge neutrality, leading to diverging resistance and current switching on the order of 104 with DC bias voltage at an approximate electric field strength of $≈$0.04 V $μ$m– 1 at high magnetic field. DC source– drain bias measurements show behavior associated with tunneling through a potential barrier and a transition between direct tunneling at low bias to Fowler-Nordheim tunneling at high bias from which the tunneling region is estimated to be on the order of $≈$100 nm. Transport becomes activated with temperature from which the gap size is estimated to be 2.4 to 2.8 meV at B = 10 T. Results suggest that a local electronically high quality region exists within the constriction, which dominates transport at high B, causing the device to become insulating and act as a tunnel junction. The use of wet transfer fabrication techniques of CVD material without encapsulation with h-BN and the combination with multiplexing illustrates the convenience of these scalable and reasonably simple methods to find high quality devices for fundamental physics research and with functional properties.","tags":[],"title":"Giant Magnetoresistance in a Chemical Vapor Deposition Graphene Constriction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abdullah Zaman","Nikita W.

Whilst pioneering lab-scale experiments have demonstrated and leveraged these interesting properties, there is still a significant gap in performance between the one-off exfoliated hero device characteristics and the average characteristics of a large graphene films suitable for scalable fabrication/manufacturing methods. Graphene films deposited by chemical vapour deposition hold the most promise to exploit the unique properties on industrial scales, yielding mobilities approaching that of the current record holding exfoliated graphene based devices. In this work three fundamental issues for the production and application of graphene films are addressed. Firstly, the issue of minute catalyst contamination is systematically studied through the use of Raman spectroscopy, image analysis and film etching to characterise the defect density of the graphene film under different parameters. It was found that the current best method of suppressing graphene nucleation density, an oxidative pretreatment to remove carbon contamination, can supply a Cu catalyst with a low level oxygen that was long undetected due to the limitations of common surface measurements. This oxygen is not only shown to increase the defect density of the graphene films, but also to significantly increase the frequency and size of unwanted adlayers in the film. As a result of the study, a simple additional reductive annealing stage was introduced to decrease the oxygen from the Cu foil after it has acted to remove carbon contamination. This new procedure allows for the beneficial effects of the oxygen pretreatment whilst negating any deleterious effects on the final film quality. The second core problem is the control of the topographical and crystallographic texture of the catalyst. It is generally agreed in the literature that Cu(111) is the ideal growth catalyst to produce the highest quality graphene, yet there is significant difficulty in producing flat single crystal Cu at wafer scale whilst still remaining cost effective. This issue is addressed by designing and optimising an integrated wafer scale deposition process for single crystal Cu on sapphire substrates. Previous work in the area has so far relied on lengthy (10~ h) high temperature oxygen annealing of the sapphire or high temperature acid baths. Here a novel in-situ deposition demonstrates that these stages can be skipped entirely once the deposition is optimized, giving a wafer-scale low roughness single crystal Cu(111) film ideal for graphene growth. The process is also demonstrated to be transferable to other targeted orientations of Cu when epi-ready MgO substrates are used, allowing for the optimization of the catalyst texture as an explorable parameter space. Finally, the question of which crystallographic orientation of catalyst is best for graphene growth and transfer is answered. The ideal graphene transfer method is proposed to be mechanical exfoliation, limiting the contamination of the catalyst that wet-transfer techniques would otherwise cause. Though Cu(111) is thought to be the best orientation for growth, it is notoriously difficult to mechanically exfoliate, so whilst the graphene may be the best quality on catalyst, it would not perform well after it is removed due to transfer-related cracks and other damage. Using extensive image stitching and alignment to correlate the crystallographic orientation of Cu with the oxidation characteristics, Raman characterisation and propensity for transfer, crystallographic (inverse pole figure) maps are created to show which facet of Cu will result in the highest quality post-transfer graphene. The systematic study demonstrates the effects of Cu oxidation on graphene before and after transfer, with Raman spectroscopy allowing for probing the action of the interfacial oxidation as it decouples the graphene from the catalyst. The study sheds light on the complexity of the Cu-graphene-transfer system, but also shows trends and patterns that point towards the ideal catalyst crystallographic orientation that will yield the best quality graphene after a peeling transfer process.","tags":[],"title":"Integrated Growth and Process Technology for Atomically Thin Single Crystal Films","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R.

A key technological challenge is deterministic and scalable spatial emitter localization, both laterally and vertically, while maintaining the full advantages of the 2D nature of the material. Here, we demonstrate emitter localization in hBN in all three dimensions via a monolayer (ML) engineering approach. We establish pretreatment processes for hBN MLs to either fully suppress or activate emission, thereby enabling such differently treated MLs to be used as select building blocks to achieve vertical (z) emitter localization at the atomic layer level. We show that emitter bleaching of ML hBN can be suppressed by sandwiching between two protecting hBN MLs, and that such thin stacks retain opportunities for external control of emission. We exploit this to achieve lateral (x-y) emitter localization via the addition of a patterned graphene mask that quenches fluorescence. Such complete emitter site localization is highly versatile, compatible with planar, scalable processing, allowing tailored approaches to addressable emitter array designs for advanced characterization, monolithic device integration, and photonic circuits.","tags":["2D materials","graphene","hBN","point defects","quantum emission","single-photon emission","spectroscopy"],"title":"Quantum Emitter Localization in Layer-Engineered Hexagonal Boron Nitride","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Oliver J Burton","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

This high-throughput and scalable approach to testing large arrays of nanodevices operates from room temperature to milli-Kelvin temperatures and is universally compatible with different materials and integration techniques. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach on two archetypal nanomaterials-graphene and semiconductor nanowires-integrated with a GaAs-based multiplexer using wet or dry transfer methods. A graphene film grown by chemical vapor deposition is transferred and patterned into an array of individual devices, achieving 94% yield. Device performance is evaluated using data fitting methods to obtain electrical transport metrics, showing mobilities comparable to nonmultiplexed devices fabricated on oxide substrates using wet transfer techniques. Separate arrays of indium-arsenide nanowires and micromechanically exfoliated monolayer graphene flakes are transferred using pick-and-place techniques. For the nanowire array mean values for mobility $μ$FE = 880/3180 cm2 V-1 s-1 (lower/upper bound), subthreshold swing 430 mV dec-1, and on/off ratio 3.1 decades are extracted, similar to nonmultiplexed devices. In another array, eight mechanically exfoliated graphene flakes are transferred using techniques compatible with fabrication of two-dimensional superlattices, with 75% yield. Our results are a proof-of-concept demonstration of a versatile platform for scalable fabrication and cryogenic characterization of nanomaterial device arrays, which is compatible with a broad range of nanomaterials, transfer techniques, and device integration strategies from the forefront of quantum technology research.","tags":["Electronic characterization","Graphene and 2D materials","High-throughput testing","Nanoelectronic device arrays","Nanowires","Scalable fabrication"],"title":"High-Throughput Electrical Characterization of Nanomaterials from Room to Cryogenic Temperatures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Oliver J.

We employ a sandwich arrangement between a commercial polycrystalline Cu foil and c-plane sapphire wafer and show that close-spaced vacuum sublimation across the confined gap can result in an epitaxial, single-crystal Cu(111) film at high growth rate. The arrangement is scalable (we demonstrate 2$″$ wafer scale) and suppresses reactor contamination with Cu. While starting with an impure Cu foil, the freshly prepared Cu film is of high purity as measured by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. We seamlessly connect the initial metallization with subsequent graphene growth via the introduction of hydrogen and gaseous carbon precursors, thereby eliminating contamination due to substrate transfer and common lengthy catalyst pretreatments. We show that the sandwich approach also enables for a Cu surface with nanometer scale roughness during graphene growth and thus results in high quality graphene similar to previously demonstrated Cu enclosure approaches. We systematically explore the parameter space and discuss the opportunities, including subsequent dry transfer, generality, and versatility of our approach particularly regarding the cost-efficient preparation of different single crystal film orientations and expansion to other material systems.","tags":["2D material","Chemical vapor deposition","Copper","Cu","Epitaxial metal film","Graphene","Single crystal"],"title":"Integrated Wafer Scale Growth of Single Crystal Metal Films and High Quality Graphene","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vitaliy Babenko","Ye Fan","Vlad Petru Veigang-Radulescu","Barry Brennan","Andrew J.

Cost-effective, scalable and high quality growth techniques for h-BN layers are critically required. We utilise widely-available iron foils for the catalytic chemical vapour deposition (CVD) of h-BN and report on the significant role of bulk dissolved species in h-BN CVD, and specifically, the balance between dissolved oxygen and carbon. A simple pre-growth conditioning step of the iron foils enables us to tailor an error-tolerant scalable CVD process to give exceptionally large h-BN monolayer domains. We also develop a facile method for the improved transfer of as-grown h-BN away from the iron surface by means of the controlled humidity oxidation and subsequent rapid etching of a thin interfacial iron oxide; thus, avoiding the impurities from the bulk of the foil. We demonstrate wafer-scale (2$″$) production and utilise this h-BN as a protective layer for graphene towards integrated (opto-)electronic device fabrication.","tags":["2D materials","chemical vapor deposition","encapsulation","hexagonal boron nitride","large crystal","monolayer","transfer"],"title":"Oxidising and Carburising Catalyst Conditioning for the Controlled Growth and Transfer of Large Crystal Monolayer Hexagonal Boron Nitride","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan J.

Here we demonstrate the controllable cation and anion selectivity of both monolayer graphene and hexagonal boron nitride. In particular, we measure the ionic current through membranes grown by chemical vapor deposition containing well-known defects inherent to scalably produced and wet-transferred 2D materials. We observe a striking change from cation selectivity with monovalent ions to anion selectivity by controlling the concentration of multivalent ions and inducing charge inversion on the 2D membrane. Furthermore, we find good agreement between our experimental data and theoretical predictions from the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation and use this model to extract selectivity ratios. These tunable selective membranes conduct up to 500 anions for each cation and thus show potential for osmotic power generation.","tags":["anion-selective","charge inversion","GHK","graphene","hBN","ion-selective membranes","tunable"],"title":"Tunable Anion-Selective Transport through Monolayer Graphene and Hexagonal Boron Nitride","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Y.

While historically used as a lubricant in powder form, h-BN layers have become particularly attractive as an ultimately thin insulator, barrier, or encapsulant. Practically all emerging electronic and photonic device concepts currently rely on h-BN exfoliated from small bulk crystallites, which limits device dimensions and process scalability. We here focus on a systematic understanding of Pt-catalyzed h-BN crystal formation, in order to address this integration challenge for monolayer h-BN via an integrated chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process that enables h-BN crystal domain sizes exceeding 0.5 mm and a merged, continuous layer in a growth time of less than 45 min. The process makes use of commercial, reusable Pt foils and allows a delamination process for easy and clean h-BN layer transfer. We demonstrate sequential pick-up for the assembly of graphene/h-BN heterostructures with atomic layer precision, while minimizing interfacial contamination. The approach can be readily combined with other layered materials and enables the integration of CVD h-BN into high-quality, reliable 2D material device layer stacks.","tags":["2D materials","Catalyst","CVD","Graphene","H-BN","Heterostructures","Platinum","Transfer"],"title":"A Peeling Approach for Integrated Manufacturing of Large Monolayer H-BN Crystals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Philipp Braeuninger-Weimer","Oliver Burton","Robert S.

Angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, He ion microscopy, and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry show that the monolayer graphene remains undamaged and its intrinsic strain is released by the interface oxidation.

While oxidation is widely used to remove impurities in metal catalysts and to control the nucleation density of graphene, we show that minute concentrations of residual bulk oxygen can significantly deteriorate the quality of as-grown graphene highlighted by an increased Raman D/G ratio, increased propensity to postgrowth etching, and increased fraction of multilayer graphene nucleation. Starting from commercial Cu foils, we show that a simple hydrogen annealing step after the initial oxidation allows us to lower the residual oxygen level as measured by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry to produce graphene of significantly higher quality. This can be effectively combined with a short hydrocarbon exposure time of 10 min to achieve near full monolayer graphene coverage, suitable for emerging industrial applications. We show that residual oxygen can have an equally significant impact on Fe-catalyzed h-BN CVD and discuss the underlying mechanisms with parallels to well-known processes in metallurgy, catalysis, and vacuum science.","tags":[],"title":"The Role and Control of Residual Bulk Oxygen in the Catalytic Growth of 2D Materials","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1493251200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493251200,"objectID":"2aed178b8161aa6f3f33fc3906e7cdec","permalink":"https://example.com/project/flawless/","publishdate":"2017-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/flawless/","section":"project","summary":"A Royal Society summer exhibition I created for graphene-based sensors.","tags":["Video"],"title":"Mind the (nano) gap","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"62c073ba8f08c4343dd6008f3d0c12c8","permalink":"https://example.com/project/nanogap/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/nanogap/","section":"project","summary":"A general audience video explaining my early PhD research on graphene growth.","tags":["Video"],"title":"Flawless - NanoVignettes","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Background This project was done in the first year of my PhD as a side project, with a colleague and friend - Isabella Miele.\nDeafblindness is “a combined sight and hearing loss causing difficulties with communication, access to information and mobility”[1]. This unique disability affects an estimated 394,000 people in the UK only with different degrees of severity [2]. Either or both of the disabilities that form deafblindness can be congenital or acquired in later life for example due to ageing. The combined hearing and vision loss affects significantly the life of an individual even if, when taken separately, each single sensory impairment can be relatively mild. Due to an increasing ageing population, this combined sensory disability is predicted to affect half a million of the UK population by 2030 [3]. Living with deafblindness is very challenging, both for the individual and for the family members as the combination of the two impairments creates a unique and severe disability which impacts heavily on how an individual knows and interacts with the external world. In deafblindess, not only communication is impaired but access and retrieval of information and mobility are significantly affected too. Technology for either blind or deaf people has improved significantly over the past decades. A plethora of applications and software is available to read both digital and physical documents aloud or send it to a braille keyboard. Deaf people now have the ability to speak using advanced synthesised voices, allowing for natural communication over the telephone. Unfortunately, braille keyboards can be anywhere from £1500 to £10000 [4] and if a person suffers from deafblindness most of the existing technology for either disability is no longer an option. Commercial offerings of braille displays and speech recognition software operate under closed systems, whereby devices and software obtained from one manufacturer cannot be used with those from another. It is therefore extremely difficult and expensive for a potential developer to integrate existing commercial technology for the deaf and blind, raising the barrier for the advancement and uptake of technologies to assist people affected by a combined sight and hearing loss.\nProject overview This project sets out to develop a means whereby deafblind people can communicate with the external world. In this work, we combine open source speech-recognition technologies with a haptic interface to develop a new assistive technology device which gives braille-literate deafblind people the ability to understand spoken words. Recently, it has become cost-effective and easy to interface software with custom-purpose hardware, such as in the open-source Arduino and Raspberry Pi projects. We decided to leverage this and focus on the novel aspects of our technology rather than spending development time on low-level hardware control, or on advanced machine learning algorithms underpinning a speech-recognition software. A simplified block diagram of the system developed is displayed below. Software able to convert speech directly into braille has been created using already available speech-to-text interpreters such as Sphynx and Google’s speech API [7]. Spoken words, captured by means of microphone are firstly translated to text by the speech-recognition software on a Raspberry Pi. The text is then sent serially to an Arduino which processes it into a form that can be taken by our novel haptic interface, based on miniaturized linear actuators, and finally displayed into braille.\nFigure 1 Simplified block diagram of the system developed.\nDue to the constraints of the braille letter size, a very small motor was needed to drive the mechanism. We chose a cheaply and readily available 4-wire-2-phase stepper motor (shown in figure 2) to drive the mechanism. At under 3.5mm in diameter, these stepper motors rotated in 1/8th turns at a minimum of 5ms per step (up to 25 rotations per second) allowing for ample speed and control in a very compact space. As can be seen in figure 2, the motors are extremely small with the shaft having helical grooves that were found to match up to a M1 nut. A small metal rod was soldered onto the nut to act as the pin, and another piece of metal was shaped to confine the movement of the pin along the axis of the shaft. Each of the motor’s coils were 23 ohms and required a current of approximately 50mA to provide unobstructed rotation of the shaft. In this project we used the Arduino as the microcontroller to turn the text from a computer into the actuation of pins to form the braille characters. A Raspberry Pi was used as a desktop, though the basic software will work with any computer capable of running python 3.0+. The Arduino was connected to the shift register through three pins, and code written to allow the translation of text into a number of braille characters – the system is set up so that the shift registers which control each character can …","date":1456790400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1456790400,"objectID":"b5c2d6d6002991c5da650febb1a15805","permalink":"https://example.com/project/acorn/","publishdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/acorn/","section":"project","summary":"A cheap alternative to piezoelectric Braille keyboards and speech recognition implementation for deaf-blind people.","tags":["Deaf-blind","Speech recognition","Actuator","Braille","Keyboard","Engineering"],"title":"CAPE Acorn Award - speech to braille","type":"project"}]
